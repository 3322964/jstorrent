<h3>JSTorrent Help</h3>

Thank you for using JSTorrent, a torrent client for Google ChromeOS.

Having difficulty understanding how to use JSTorrent?

<ul>

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      Why do I have to select a Download Folder?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      <p>JSTorrent actually starts out with NO ACCESS to any files on your
      computer. You have to actually tell it which folder(s) it has
      access to. This is a security feature! Most desktop software
      actually has full access to your computer. Cool, huh?</p>
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      Where do the files download to?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      The first time you add a torrent, you'll be asked to select a <em>Default Download Folder</em>. The files will go there. Creating a "JSTorrent" folder to put everything in is the recommended setup.
    </span>
  </li>



  <li>
    <span class="question">
      How does this work?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      <p>
      Find a torrent file on the web, right click in your browser and
      select "<em>Copy link address</em>", now come back to JSTorrent,
      paste it into the address bar on top, and click
      "<em>Add</em>". Then your torrent download will begin!</p>

      <p>Or, simply download a ".torrent" file, and then either drag
      it into the window or just click on it in the "Files" app.</p>

      <p>To make it easier, there is a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jstorrent-contextmenu-ext/bnceafpojmnimbnhamaeedgomdcgnbjk?hl=en" target="_blank">chrome extension</a> that adds a right click menu that will do this automatically!</p>

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      My torrent isn't downloading! It says started, but isn't doing anything!
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      <p>First off, did you select your download directory?</p>

      <p>Check the "Trackers" tab and make sure there are no numbers in
      the "errors" or "timeouts" columns, and that there are numbers
      in the "seeders" column. Then check out the "Peers" tab and make
      sure you're connecting to peers.</p>
    </span>
  </li>


  <li>
    <span class="question">
      Okay, I downloaded to 100%, now what?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      You can access the files in your selected Downloads folder.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      How do I add a torrent file?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      The easiest way is to find the "<em>magnet</em>" link on a website and right click and select <em>Copy link address</em>. You can also download the torrent file to your ChromeOS Downloads folder, and then drag it into the JSTorrent window.
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      Does this work with private trackers?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      <p>With a private tracker, you'll need to download the ".torrent" file from the web browser first, and then load it into JSTorrent. This is because you need to be signed in, and JSTorrent doesn't know about your login credentials.
      </p>

      <p>That being said, there seem to be some issues with some private trackers. If you have a problem with a specific private tracker, please let me know about it and I can attempt to figure out what the problem is.</p>

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      My torrent says "error"
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      This software isn't perfect. It could be our fault. Check the system notifications and see if there is any information. One possible cause is the <em>Download Folder</em> for this torrent is missing (if it was an external drive). Please, let me know about any errors either on the <a target="_blank" href="http://google.com/+JSTorrent">Google+ JSTorrent community page</a>, or the <a href="http://jstorrent.uservoice.com" target="_blank">Suggestions Page</a>.

    <span class="question">
      I have a feature suggestion...
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      I would love to hear about it. Please share it on the <a target="_blank" href="http://google.com/+JSTorrent">Google+ JSTorrent community page</a>. Or you can share it on our <a href="http://jstorrent.uservoice.com" target="_blank">Suggestions Page</a>.

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      Can I create torrents?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      You sure can! Just drag a file into JSTorrent
    </span>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span class="question">
      Why is it so slow?
    </span>
    <span class="answer">
      JSTorrent is not as mature as other programs. ChromeOS is a new
      platform and while a bit slower than other platforms, it offers
      enhanced security and ease of use. JSTorrent is unable to access
      your private files and data, unlike other torrent clients. As
      ChromeOS matures, and you continue to use and support JSTorrent,
      the speeds will increase.
