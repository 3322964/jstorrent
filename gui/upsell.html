<h3>Buying JSTorrent Full Version</h3>

<p>Thank you for using JSTorrent Lite, a torrent client for Google ChromeOS. If you enjoyed this software and want to support its continued development, please consider purchasing the full version. Please visit the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jstorrent/anhdpjpojoipgpmfanmedjghaligalgb">JSTorrent on Chrome Web Store</a> to purchase the full version of JSTorrent.</p>

<p>The full version allows unlimited downloads and will have all the latest features</p>

<p>As a paying customer, you also have a voice in suggesting new features. </p>

<p>I am currently considering other forms of payment for users who don't have a credit card available. Please stay tuned for more details. In the meantime, it is certainly possible (and not very difficult!) to try and circumvent the download restriction. If you know a JavaScript developer, I am sure they will be able to help you.</p>

<p>If for some reason, the full version is not available in your market or country, please let me know on the <a target="_blank" href="http://google.com/+JSTorrent">JSTorrent community page</a> on Google+, and I will remove the download restriction for these markets.</p>
