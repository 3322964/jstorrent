before release of 1.1 need to:
- cleanup options text
- prevent standby when active torrents
- check on "lite" first make sure changed permissions does not prevent update

ideas for fixing disk/io bug
- due to padding with seek zeros? speed up by storing 1M of zeros in memory and re-use that
- store which jobs had to pad zeros and log % of disk i/o errors caused by that

- need to disconnect from peers when no message received in n seconds (i.e. if computer goes to sleep...)
- fix the NaN%
- add "delete torrent and files" to more actions
- fix file getting to > 100% (downloaded being incremented twice somehow)
- better handling when disconnecting external storage (display better error)
- pNaCL sha1 hashing of pieces
