- endgame mode needs to happen only when there are no incomplete pieces with chunk requests
- need to disconnect from peers when no message received in n seconds (i.e. if computer goes to sleep...)
- fix the NaN%
- add "delete torrent and files" to more actions
- fix file getting to > 100% (downloaded being incremented twice somehow)
- better handling when disconnecting external storage (display better error)
